'''
You are given a 2D matrix, a, of dimension MxN and a positive integer R.
You have to rotate each ring of the matrix R times and print the resultant matrix.
Rotation should be in anti-clockwise direction.





Input Format
First line contains three space separated integers, M,N and R,
where M is the number of rows,
 N is the number of columns in matrix, and
 R is the number of times the matrix has to be rotated.
Then M lines follow,
where each line contains N space separated positive integers.
These M lines represent the matix.'''
